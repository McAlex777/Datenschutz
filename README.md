**Description:**

The project is primarily aimed at users who want their Windows10/11 to be a cloud-free, offline system with installed applications, as it was in Windows7 times.

The Windows10/11 telemetry should be reduced as far as possible.<br> 
Several methods are used for this: Policies, service disabling, and firewall blocking.

The primary goal is a comprehensible, script-controlled conversion of the system with Microsoft board means - i.e. without external applications. A further goal is a sustainable conversion - via the standard procedures provided by Microsoft. Therefore, the primary focus is on policy configurations and the simple disabling of services.

Care was taken not to restrict the user too much with the configurations.
